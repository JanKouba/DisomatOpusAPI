# Annotation
Implementation of Schenck MinProz protocol as the most simple solution to establish communication with Disomat Opus (scale) terminal device. This example implements ONLY getting current weighed value. 

# Important information
May not work 100% correctly, due to terminal settings. It depends on serial port parameters as well as protocol settings in terminal itself. MinProz protocol must be selected, otherwise the device may not answer.
